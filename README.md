# REVIEW BRANCH

This is the review branch of the TICKET101 task. 
Normally this process should be done through pull request but for our case, sadly it is not possible as the intern decided to push the changes to the main branch.
Please check out the [REVIEW.md](REVIEW.md) to see the documented version of the review and changes.
I will use this branch to do the necessary changes if there are any, in order to help the intern to finish the TICKET101 task.

# InBank Backend Service

This service provides a REST API for calculating an approved loan amount and period for a customer.
The loan amount is calculated based on the customer's credit modifier, which is determined by the last four
digits of their ID code.

## Technologies Used

- Java 17
- Spring Boot
- [estonian-personal-code-validator:1.6](https://github.com/vladislavgoltjajev/java-personal-code)

## Requirements

- Java 17
- Gradle

## Installation

To install and run the service, please follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
3. Run `gradle build` to build the application.
4. Run `java -jar build/libs/inbank-backend-1.0.jar` to start the application

The default port is 8080.

## Endpoints

The application exposes a single endpoint:

### POST /loan/decision

The request body must contain the following fields:

- personalCode: The customer's personal ID code.
- loanAmount: The requested loan amount.
- loanPeriod: The requested loan period.

**Request example:**

```json
{
"personalCode": "50307172740",
"loanAmount": "5000",
"loanPeriod": "24"
}
```

The response body contains the following fields:

- loanAmount: The approved loan amount.
- loanPeriod: The approved loan period.
- errorMessage: An error message, if any.

**Response example:**

```json
{
"loanAmount": 2400,
"loanPeriod": 24,
"errorMessage": null
}
```

## Error Handling

The following error responses can be returned by the service:

- `400 Bad Request` - in case of an invalid input
    - `Invalid personal ID code!` - if the provided personal ID code is invalid
    - `Invalid loan amount!` - if the requested loan amount is invalid
    - `Invalid loan period!` - if the requested loan period is invalid
- `404 Not Found` - in case no valid loans can be found
    - `No valid loan found!` - if there is no valid loan found for the given ID code, loan amount, and loan period
- `500 Internal Server Error` - in case the server encounters an unexpected error while processing the request
    - `An unexpected error occurred` - if there is an unexpected error while processing the request

## Architecture

The service consists of two main classes:

- DecisionEngine: A service class that provides a method for calculating an approved loan amount and period for a customer.
- DecisionEngineController: A REST endpoint that handles requests for loan decisions.
